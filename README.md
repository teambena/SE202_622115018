            <p> My name is Teetanic Yaprasert. My Student ID is 622115018. My friends calls me Teem. I'm 19 years old now and currently study in
                first year at College of Art, Media and Technology majored in Software Engineering. The reasons I choose to study
                software engineering is I want to learn about the programming, how the code works and how do we create or
                design the program to everyone.
